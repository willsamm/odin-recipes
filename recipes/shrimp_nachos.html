        <h2>Shripm Nachos recipe</h2>
        <p>This is my most requested recipe to bring to get-together and there's always someone who hasn't had them who asks for the recipe. You can make it days ahead of time and have it out of the oven in just a few minutes when you need it. Add more chiptoles peppers if you like it spicier. This recipe makes alot, but it actually freezes well. I usually freeze half of it and have it another time. If you're making it for a party, though, bring it all because it will be gone!</p>
